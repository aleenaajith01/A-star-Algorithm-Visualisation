# A*-Algorithm-Visualisatioon
The A* search algorithm is a popular pathfinding algorithm used in many applications, including video games, robotics, and route planning. A* is an extension of Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm and uses heuristics to improve the efficiency of the search by prioritizing paths that are likely to be closer to the goal.
